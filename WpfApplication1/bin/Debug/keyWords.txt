*If you have any keyword in you grammer you should enter them here.
* as I mentioned in DFA.txt file, the lexer type for all the keywords is the sames
* as the keywords text. for example, if you declare "while" as a keyword then 
* lexer will return "while" as it's type so you can use "while" in you grammer.
* The default type for all the names is "id" unless you declare them as a keyword
* here.
if

*we should mention the delimeters here. I recommend to leave this line untouched.
