***********************************************************************
*                         PLEASE DONT TOUCH THIS FILE                 *
***********************************************************************
*This lexer supports almost all the aspect of a common language
*to be more exact this lexer supports:
*1.one-line comment starting with "//" and multi-line comment"/*Hi*/"
*2.<= => == != += -= = + * > < ! / ( ) [ ] # " ++ --  
*3.numbers (lexer output for numbers is "num" so you can use "num" in your grammer
*  whenever you need numbers e.g "operation->num <operator> num = num ;"
*4.typical names (names can't start with a number)
*  Lexer type for all names is "id" unless you define them as a keyword in 
*  keyword.txt file
*  Type of all keywords are equal to their name e.g if "While" is a keyword
*  then the Type that returned by lexer is "While" so u can use it in your
*  grammer
*5.strings e.g "Hi i am a string". Lexer type for strings is "string" so you can
*  use it in your grammers e.g. "contactnation->string = string . string ;".
*  you can use any character inside strings and comments like Persian or chinease
*  characters. Lexer will ignore them.
**************************************************
*First line should be the mapping of characters to numbers which is done by an
* array called CTN in lexer. We should use "A" for all letters(english letters only),
*  "2" for all number, "enter" for enter and "space" for space.
A 2 * / { } " ; space enter + ( ) : , - ? . = \ ! < > & [ ] #
*now we should enter Non-Final state(s). (any state that you dont mention here 
* is considered as a final-state in lexer DFA.
0 4
*0 is also a state and ofcourse it's non-final state
*we should enter the number of rows of DFA table.
50
*now the table itself
* IMPORTANT NOTE: 0 is reserved for rejecting and it's should always used as a non-final state
*  so the first should always be zero.
* IMPORTANT NOTE:as I mentioned before since I hard-coded some state(s) to allow accepting any character
*  like Persian language inside comments and string you should not change this file unless
*  you realy know what you are doing.
